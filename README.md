# CocktailDex

This is a SPA ([check it out](https://goofy-kilby-a44821.netlify.app/)) using Svelte to browse the [CocktailDB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/) for any cocktail. Right now it's still very...let's call it minimalistic. But I will come back to this at a later time to add more images, colors and animations.

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd cocktaildex
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.
